## A Fully Functional AI-Powered Movie Web Application 🤖🎬🍿

This Application ([Popcornflix](https://popcornflix.vercel.app/)) is a fully functional Movie Web Application with an AI-Assistant who can help you through voice commands with a lot of things like saying:

1. "Make it light/dark" => to toggle the application theme.
2. "Log me in" => to Login
3. "Get me out of here" => to Logout
4. "Go to (any category from the side bar)" => this command will navigate you to the required category
5. "Search for (any name)" => to search about the name of the movie you have said
6. Try anything like: "I'm bored", "It's Hallowen" => to make him suggest a list of movies for you.
7. "Surprise Me" => to make him make a guess about your style of movies
   And much much more...
